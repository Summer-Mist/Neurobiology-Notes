# Classical synapse theory
most used: 
* NMJ
  - muscle cell is huge
  - hundreds of boutons, strong and reliable transmission
* small central synapse
  - small quantal yield
* Calyx of Held synapse
  - huge, therefore available for Ca imaging or cell patching
  
## types of neurotransmitter release
Fast release:
1. triggered by syt1 and bulk Ca2+ influx
2. lasts 20-30 ms
3. essential for nerve impulse propagation

Slow release:
1. triggered by Doc2 and residual [Ca2+]i
2. lasts several hundred ms
3. Important for neural network excitation
4. Asynchronous release is crucial for the modulation of
postsynaptic action potential firing pattern
5. Asynchronous release is critical for reverberation

Quantal release
1. mEEP, can be recorded under low [Ca]_o
2. can be recorded in small central synapses
